GyikSoft Mailer for UNIX  v3.7    (C) 1997-2001 by A'rpi & Pilu of ESP-team
========================  ====

This is a simple e-mail reader program for UNIX, based on the original DOS
version called 'GyikSoft Mailer for DOS v3.4' written in Borland Pascal.
Currently Pegasus Mail for DOS (.PMM files) and standard UNIX folders
(and so Netscape's Inbox as well) are supported for reading.

New in Version 3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Folder handler is separated into a library. Features:
  Indexed folders -> much faster re-reading, save flags, less memory usage
- Better terminal I/O routines -> understand codes of most terminals, but
  use TERMCAP if exists. Doesn't require (N)CURSES !


Main features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Support MIME multipart mail format
- Decode BASE64 attachments and messages
- Decode quoted-printable messages
- Display ISO-encoded headers correctly (many other mailer doesn't)
- Read, Reply, Forward, Compose functions
* - Multi-level address-book
- New mail notification (checked every 2 seconds)
- Optimized for slow TELNET connection (minimal redrawing, one-key commands)
- Optimized for speed (own buffered string reader, string routines)

History:
~~~~~~~~
1. Idea by Pilu               - writting a mail viewer for DOS in Borland C
2. DOS version by A'rpi       - written in Borland Pascal, still developed
3. UNIX version v1.0 by Pilu  - some a part of pascal sources translated to C
4. UNIX version v2.0 by A'rpi - developed in ANSI C, under LINUX
5. UNIX version v3.0 by A'rpi - most parts are rewritten (libMail, TermIO...)

Future:  (not yet implemented)
~~~~~~~
- send attachments
- compress folder (really delete mails)
- save mail, save non-base64 attachments
- selection  (F7,X,Sh+F7,P)

Far future:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- aliases, hotkeys
- mail-lists (HIX, listserv digest, majordomo digest) as folder
- select folder
- del,copy,move mail between folders
- filters
- HTML support
- Internal reader prog
