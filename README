GyikSoft Mailer for UNIX  v2.0pre3    (C) 1997-99 by A'rpi & Pilu of ESP-team
========================  ========

This is a simple e-mail reader program for UNIX, based on the original DOS
version called 'GyikSoft Mailer for DOS v3.4' written in Borland Pascal.
Currently Pegasus Mail for DOS (.PMM files) and standard UNIX folders
(and so Netscape's Inbox as well) are supported for reading.

Main features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Support MIME multipart mail format
- Decode BASE64 attachments and mails
- Decode quoted-printable mails
- Display ISO-encoded headers correctly (many other mailer doesn't)
- Read, Reply, Forward, Compose functions
- Multi-level address-book
- New mail notification (checked every 5 seconds)
- Optimized for slow TELNET connection (minimal redrawing)
- Optimized for speed (own buffered string reader, string routines)
