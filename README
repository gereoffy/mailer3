GyikSoft Mailer for UNIX  v3.7    (C) 1997-2002 by A'rpi & Pilu of ESP-team
========================  ====

This is a simple e-mail reader program for UNIX, based on the original DOS
version called 'GyikSoft Mailer for DOS v3.4' written in Borland Pascal.
(ftp://thot.banki.hu/esp-team/dos/gysm32b3.zip)
Currently Pegasus Mail for DOS (.PMM files) and standard UNIX mailbox/folders
(and so Netscape's Inbox as well) are supported for reading.

It was originally written for SGI IRIX 5/6, later ported to LINUX and AIX.
Currently it's developed on LINUX only, so I cannot guarantee that it still
works on AIX or IRIX.

Send patches, bugreports and ideas to <arpi@mplayerhq.hu>
(Note: I don't have time to work on this project, so patches are more
welcomed than feature requests :))


New in Version 3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Folder handler is separated into a library. Features:
  Indexed folders -> much faster re-reading, save flags, less memory usage
- Better terminal I/O routines -> understand codes of most terminals, but
  use TERMCAP if exists. Doesn't require (N)CURSES !


Main features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Support MIME multipart mail format
- Decode BASE64 attachments and messages
- Decode quoted-printable messages
- Display ISO-encoded headers correctly (many other mailer doesn't)
- Read, Reply, Forward, Compose functions
* - Multi-level address-book
- New mail notification (checked every 2 seconds)
- Optimized for slow TELNET connection (minimal redrawing, one-key commands)
- Optimized for speed (own buffered string reader, string routines)

2. DOS version by A'rpi       - written in Borland Pascal, still developed
3. UNIX version v1.0 by Pilu  - some a part of pascal sources translated to C
4. UNIX version v2.x by A'rpi - developed in ANSI C, under LINUX
5. UNIX version v3.x by A'rpi - most parts are rewritten (libMail, TermIO...)
